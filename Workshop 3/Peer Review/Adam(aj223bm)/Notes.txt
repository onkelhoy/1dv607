Notes for all

-The code is runnable. No compile time errors. 

-No problemsor buggsf ound. The Ace is calculated correctly.

-There is an association between PlayGame and IView not a dependancy.
Oterwise the UML class diagram is correct.

- Observer pattorn. Player to subject but still Player has the method
notify() whitch the observer should have allthough this is not a major
problem. The pattern shows that if observer A makes a changes observer
B should get the change, in this case the subject 'triggers' the change.
We also miss some out-prints beacuse of the printing method is called somewhere
but then just keeps on adding breaklines (1500 lines to be exact which is a bit too much..).

-You did no solw the hidden dependancy.
We belive the hidden deppendancey is stil there. 
 (hint) we sweds maybe want 's' to stand for spela (play)

	or if user does not have a 'p' on keyboard (e.g. a chinese keyboard)
	we will need to hardcode the logic to change this, instead of just
	adding a different view (e.g a chineseView)
	(although a chinese keyboard does have a 'p' you should get the point)

- In playerthere is a method called Addsub(). Try to use standard java naming convention when you rogram.
	Insted it sould be AddSub() acording to java naming convetion.

- The Strategy patern is implemented correctly Soft17 but the oneAce in Soft17Strategy dead code.

- Yes the win strategy is implemented corectly.

- Their dealing of a card stategy is not the best, they reduced to duplicate code by adding a dublicate code in the dealer
 (you can use the 2nd method and just pass in a true instead of having another method for only the case of true)
also you are just adding more dependency, try using an alternative method like an abstract class or something).

what we mean is: you already have all you need to make this method in the hit class, why make it so that dealer have to deal with it?
		- you dont even use the Deck you are provided with..

- Not implemented or not implemented correctly
		:Remove the bad, hidden, dependency between the controller and view (new game, hit, stand)
		:The code for getting a card from the deck, show the card and give it to a player is duplicated in a number of places. 
		 Make a refactoring to remove this duplication and that supports low coupling/high cohesion. The code that is duplicated i similar to this
		: Observer may be working but it's not folowing the pattern 100%
