Notes for all

- No UML class diagram that we could find.

- The hidden dependancy is handled. although it can be made much simpliar
  and will reduce your code slighlty (by using a value of some sort instead
  of creating methods for each scenario play,hit,stand). 

- Soft17 is implemented

- Duplicated code is still there

- Observer pattern not implemented
