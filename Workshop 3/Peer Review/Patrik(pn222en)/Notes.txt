Notes for all

- No UML class diagram that we could find.

- The hidden dependancy is handled. although it can be made much simpliar
  and will reduce your code slighlty (by using a value of some sort instead
  of creating methods for each scenario play,hit,stand). 

- Soft17 is implemented
	hasAce is not madatory in this solution. You can get away with a
	less code, but this is just picky and one could say this adds
	readability.

- Win strategy is implemented. 

- Duplicated code is still there, it seams that the group has completly
  forgotten about this. Or maybe they missunderstood, but the part
	c = deck.GetCard()
	c.show(..)
	player.DealCard(c)

  is dublicated both in AmericanNewGameStrategy and InternatioalNewGameStrategy
  and should be logiclly removed. One could argue about the same code in Dealer
  but we don't.

- Observer pattern not implemented. The Interface is created and implemented in PlayGame
  but the code is not implemented, the implementation of the Observer pattern is not used
  completly correct. But it's on a good direction to solving the problem.
