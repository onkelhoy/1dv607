##Fix issues - *mail from Ioseff*
Hi,
There are a few minor changes I would like you to make before I can mark your group as passed for workshop 2 grade 2. Comments below:
The model should not build formatted strings to be displayed by the view (e.g. in your use of the toString methods and verboseInfo()) - this ties the model to a certain type of view (console based). The controller should also not build formatted strings. Differentiation between compact and verbose lists should happen in the view - the same list of objects should be used each time but the view should choose to print them differently. Please fix these issues and send me a link to the revised version.

Best,
-Ioseff
