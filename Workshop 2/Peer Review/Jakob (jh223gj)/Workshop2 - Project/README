I never use Java outside of school assignments so I have very little 
knowledge about the Java environment. However, I have successfully 
compiled and tested this program on two different Linux distributions
using only
	$ javac Registry.java
	$ java Registry
from the "src"-directory. 
If that doesn't work, try to compile specifying the classpath.

The menus in the program are a bit buggy, you may have to press ENTER 
more than once (the requirements state that "it does not need to be 
user friendly"). 

The file "members.xml" already contains two members so you can
verify if the file loading works.

The diagrams consists of one class diagram and two sequence diagrams,
one for "Create Member" and one for "List Members". I have simplified
several of the names in the diagrams.
