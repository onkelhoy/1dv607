UI:
1.
Setting length of a boat does not have a safty as it crashes if not an integer
2.
cant update a boat with new type (even though it says it should)

Code:
1.
setting type of a boat in xmlHandlers class, takes a switch case that checks chars and then based on the char value
sets a boat with a number. In the Boat class it checks again with a switch to see what number, instead this could be achived
not check the type in xmlHandlers but only in boat.
2.
Memberinfo, MemberList and XmlHandlers servers no purpose of a class, MemberInfo could be in Member class, and XmlHandlers 
could be in MemberDB, MemberList is a list class, it should implement a list instead of having it beacuse if not it could just be a list
be a list in RegistryCtrl
3.
What purpose does UpdateMember have (as a class)? its like a menu class but it only handles Member events, why not just have
some sort of a menu class that handles all the menu things instead of splitting it up in both RegistryCrtl and UpdateMember

ClassDiagram:
1.
its a bit messy - two MemberDB?
