##Mail from Ioseff
Hi!

I have finished grading your submission for workshop 1 grade 2. Before I can pass you there are a few modifications I would like you to make and then reply to this email with the changed version. Comments below.

###Modifications
- I can't think of a good difference between Calendar and ClubCalendar so I'm not sure why both need to exist.

- The Treasurer does not appear to have a role and thus can be omitted.

- There is no need for multiple relationships between conceptual classes when one will suffice to imply the other (e.g. the additional "manages" relationship between Member and Boat).

- "Has" is not a good choice for a relationship name.

- It should be possible for boats and berths to exist within the system without being assigned (e.g. an empty berth).

- The Proposal concept does not seem to be very important to this particular domain model, nor does it add any clarity, therefore it should be removed.

- You are missing some relationship names.


Best,
-Ioseff
