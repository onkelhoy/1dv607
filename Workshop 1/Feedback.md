##Mail from Ioseff
Hi!

I have finished grading your submission for workshop 1 grade 2. 
Before I can pass you there are a few modifications I would like you to make and then reply
to this email with the changed version. Comments below.

###Modifications
- [x] I can't think of a good difference between Calendar and ClubCalendar so I'm not sure why 
	both need to exist.

- [x] The Treasurer does not appear to have a role and thus can be omitted.

- [x] There is no need for multiple relationships between conceptual classes when one will suffice
	to imply the other (e.g. the additional "manages" relationship between Member and Boat).

- [x] "Has" is not a good choice for a relationship name.

- [x] It should be possible for boats and berths to exist within the system without being assigned 
	(e.g. an empty berth). **_- dont really understand this one?_**

- [x] The Proposal concept does not seem to be very important to this particular domain model, 
	nor does it add any clarity, therefore it should be removed.

- [x] You are missing some relationship names. (maybe fixed)


Best,
-Ioseff
